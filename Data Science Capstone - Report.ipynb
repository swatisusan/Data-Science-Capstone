Restaurant bussinees survive in areas that are heavily populated, popular or areas with heavy foot traffice. Factors such as the ethinicity of the population can also contribute to the success or failure of a restaurant. This project will analyse the neighburhoods in New York and the type of restaurants that are present in a neighbourhood. Using the information from the analyses I will determine the best option for a future restaurant in each neighbourhood in New York"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data for the project\n\nUse the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City. \nNeighbourhood data for New York - https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Methodology\n\n# Download and Explore Dataset\n\nNew York City is split up into five boroughs: the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. The neighborhoods in New York City are located within the five boroughs of the City of New York. Their names and borders are not officially defined, and they change from time to time. For this project I will be using the data from https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572. The data is loaded and transformed into a pandas dataframe. The data is explred to look into the features fo the various neighbourhoods. Use geopy librabry to get the latitude and and logitude on New York City and then create a map of New York City with the neighbourhoods superimposed. This gives a visual representation of the data.\n\n# Explore Neighborhoods in New York City\nUse geopy library to get the latitude and longitude of each of the five boroughs:the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. Create a map for each borough along with the neighbourhoods superimposed on it. Use foursquare to examine the neighbourhoods within the boroughs.\n\n# Analyze Each Neighborhood\nEach Neighbourhood within a borough is examined using the four square data.Determine the frequency of occurence of business and the five most common business within a neighbourhood.\n\n\n# Cluster Neighborhoods\nUse K means to cluster the data in five groups.
